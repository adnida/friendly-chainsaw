## Contracts
Three contracts for storage:
- Restaurants (registers restaurants, add menu)
- Customers (registers customers)
- Orders (registers food orders: piece things together into an order; calls Restaurants and Customers contracts)

One contract for logic and control:
- FoodDelivery (to be written)
